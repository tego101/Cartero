# Cartero

âœ… A fast and lightweight SMTP outgoing catch-all built with Golang, designed to intercept and display all outgoing emails in a user-friendly web interface.

## Features

- **Catches outgoing emails** via SMTP on port 1025.
- **Parses and Displays emails** in a list format on `localhost:10122`.
- **Click on an email** to view its parsed HTML and raw email data.
- **Extracts links** from emails and displays them in plain text.

## How It Works

Cartero listens for outgoing emails on SMTP port 1025, captures all email traffic, and presents a list of those emails through a local web interface. You can click on any email to see both the raw email data and its parsed HTML. Any links present in the email content are automatically extracted and displayed in plain text.

3. Run the application:
